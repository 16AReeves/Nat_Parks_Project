# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis within Jupyter Notebook. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
PGAdmin is the database we intend to use to join data from the separate CSV files.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier within Jupyter Notebook. Our training and testing setup is to reserve 80% training data and 20% testing data. Within the SciKitLearn library, we will be utilizing the following modules:
- Linear Regression Analysis
- Random Forest Model
- Dendogram Classificaition
Once training is done we will extract results to CSV with Jupyter Notebook.

## Dashboard
Tableau is the dashboard we will be using to display our proposal to the National Parks Service via Storyboard and Presentation.
