# Initial imports

# Load csv files into df

# # Use unsupervised learning to explore the data

# check for null values

# drop unnecessary columns and change columns w/ get_dummies as needed

# check dtypes of columns are all numerical for testing

# scale data w/ StandardScaler() [if needed]

# USE PCA to reduce dimensions to # of dimensions needed
    # [scramble through module to find y they used 3 in the challenge (Mod 18)]
    # this might be where the dendrogram happens

# K-Means
# best value for K
# graph elbow curve

# graph 3d model of scatter plot using PCA values






# # Use Supervised Learning to explore the data and relationships

# Both Multiple/Linear Regression Model - species id, trail, occurrence, abundance (etc)
    # 1.Trail popularity (or avg trail popularity per park) w/ biodiversity (species count per park)

# Random Forest Model

# EasyClassiferEnsamble (b/c in module challenge it seemed to be the most "accurate")
